# Chapter 3

## Programs

A C program consits of only _function definitions_ and _structure definitions_.

A source file is a list of _functions_ and _types_.

The functions can call each other or themselves.

C programs always starts in the function `main`

## Variables 

	int i = 10;

## Functions

	int add(int x, int y) {
		int result = x + y;
		return result;
	}

	int added = add(2, 2);

## Structure Declarations

Are used to declare new _types_. Structures are several variables bundled
togheter.

	typedef struct {
		float x;
		float y;
	} point;

	point p;
	p.x = 0.1;
	p.y = 10.0;

## Pointers 

## Strings

In C striungs are represented by the pointer type `char*`, under the hood they are stored as a list of character, where the final charater is _null_.

## Conditionals

	if (z > 10 && x < 100) {
		puts();
	} else {
		puts();
	}

## Loops

### while

	int i = 10;
	while (i > 0) {
		puts("Loop iteration");
		i = i - 1;
	}

### for

	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		puts("Loop iteration");
	}
